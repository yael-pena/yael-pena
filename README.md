## Hi there 👋

I’m Yael — a CS student at UIC with a strong interest in software development, game engineering, and understanding how systems work under the hood. I enjoy building things that are practical, impactful, or simply fun to use.

## Where I Started

I’ve always been drawn to technology and creating things with it. That interest eventually led me to rebuild *Fire Emblem 6* in a modern engine, which forced me to learn C#, Assembly, debugging, optimization, and how real systems behave at a low level. It was tedious and frustrating at times, but the process taught me skills I wouldn’t trade for anything.

## What I’m Doing Now

- Studying CS at UIC  
- Working on side projects and sharpening my fundamentals  
- Learning new tools and improving my workflow  
- Building an online presence and documenting my progress

## Current Goals

- Break into software engineering, game development, app development, or systems programming  
- Continue improving my programming skills across languages and tools  
- Build projects that prove my abilities and push my limits

## Technical Skills

**Languages**
- C
- C++
- C#
- Java
- Assembly (ARM/GBA)

**Tools & Areas**
- Debugging  
- Optimization  
- Game development  
- Reverse engineering / ROM hacking  
- Git & version control  
- Content creation / video editing (for personal projects)
